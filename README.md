Data science is a fast rolling industry/subject, which often requires knowledge from different fields. 
Here I plan to summarize what I have learned so far from preparing interviews for data scientist positions at FAANG.
It will include content such as: 
* Pruduct Sense
* SQL/database
* Machine learning
* Statistics
* Deep learning
* Python coding(Algorithm and data structure, leetcode style)
* Python coding(scripting, data manipulation, non-LC style)
