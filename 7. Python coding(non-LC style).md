* how to read a file and count how many characters are upper case? Do it in one line of code. 

```python
count = sum(1 for line in open('path_to_file') for char in line if char.isupper())
```

* What if the file is very large?

```python
with open('path_to_file') as fh:  
    count = sum(1 for line in fh for char in line if char.isupper())
```

* read file

```python
with open('my_file.txt') as my_file:
    for line in my_file:
        do_stuff_with(line.rstrip())

## the .rstrip() method is optional. It removes trailing whitespace
## from the line (including the newline character).
```

* If you don't want to iterate on lines, which is the most memory-efficient way to deal with text files, you can slurp entire contents of a file at once like this:

```python
with open('my_file.txt') as my_file:
    file_text = my_file.read()
```


* add arguments

Note that sys.argv[0] is the name of the script.

```python
import sys
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    do_stuff_with(arg)

```


* path

```python
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> # make a path of the current directory
>>> p = Path()
>>> p
PosixPath('.')
>>> # iterate over directory contents
>>> for i in p.iterdir():
...     print(repr(i))
PosixPath('.git')
PosixPath('out.html')
PosixPath('README.rst')]
>>> # use filename globbing
>>> for i in p.glob('*.rst'):
...     print(repr(i))
PosixPath('README.rst')
>>> # get the full path
>>> p = p.absolute()
>>> p
PosixPath('/home/ninjaaron/doc/replacing-bash-scripting-with-python')
>>> # get the basename of the file
>>> p.name
'replacing-bash-scripting-with-python'
>>> # name of the parent directory
>>> p.parent
PosixPath('/home/ninjaaron/doc')
>>> # split path into its parts.
>>> p.parts
('/', 'home', 'ninjaaron', 'doc', 'replacing-bash-scripting-with-python')
>>> # do some tests about what the path is or isn't.
>>> p.is_dir()
True
>>> p.is_file()
False
>>> # more detailed file stats.
>>> p.stat()
os.stat_result(st_mode=16877, st_ino=16124942, st_dev=2051, st_nlink=3, st_uid=1000, st_gid=100, st_size=4096, st_atime=1521557933, st_mtime=1521557860, st_ctime=1521557860)
>>> # create new child paths with slash.
>>> readme = p/'README.rst'
>>> readme
PosixPath('/home/ninjaaron/doc/replacing-bash-scripting-with-python/README.rst')
>>> # open files
>>> with readme.open() as file_handle:
...     pass
>>> # make file executable with mode bits
>>> readme.chmod(0o755)
>>> # ^ note that octal notation is must be explicite.
```


* file operation

```python
>>> import shutil
>>> # $ mv src dest
>>> shutil.move('src', 'dest')
>>> # $ cp src dest
>>> shutil.copy2('src', 'dest')
>>> # $ cp -r src dest
>>> shutil.copytree('src', 'dest')
>>> # $ rm a_file
>>> os.remove('a_file') # ok, that's not shutil
>>> # $ rm -r a_dir
>>> shutil.rmtree('a_dir')
>>> # $ tar caf 'my_archive.tar.gz' 'my_folder'
>>> shutil.make_archive('my_archive.tar.gz', 'gztar', 'my_folder')
>>> # $ tar xaf 'my_archive.tar.gz'
>>> shutil.unpack_archive('my_archive.tar.gz')
>>> # chown user:ninjaaron a_file.txt
>>> shutil.chown('a_file.txt', 'ninjaaron', 'user')
>>> # info about disk usage, a bit like `df`, but not exactly.
>>> shutil.disk_usage('.')
usage(total=123008450560, used=86878904320, free=36129546240)
>>> #  ^ sizes in bytes
>>> # which vi
>>> shutil.which('vi')
'/usr/bin/vi'
>>> # info about the terminal you're running in.
>>> shutil.get_terminal_size()
os.terminal_size(columns=138, lines=30)
```


* Grep 

If you don't need pattern matching (i.e. something you could do with fgrep), you don't need regex to match a substring. You can simply use built-in syntax:

```python
>>> 'substring' in 'string containing substring'
True
```

```python
>>> import re
>>> re.search(r'a pattern', r'string containing a pattern')
<_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(18, 27), match='a pattern'>
>>> re.search(r'a pattern', r'string without the pattern')
>>> # Returns None, which isn't printed in the Python REPL
```

So, to use these to filter through strings:

```python
>>> ics = an_iterable_containing_strings
>>> # like fgrep
>>> filtered = (s for s in ics if substring in s)
>>> # like grep (or, more like egrep)
>>> filtered = (s for s in ics if re.search(pattern, s))
```

an_iterable_containing_strings here could be a list, a generator or even a file/file-like object. Anything that will give you strings when you iterate on it. I use generator expression syntax here instead of a list comprehension because that means each result is produced as needed with lazy evaluation. This will save your RAM if you're working with a large file. You can invert the result, like grep -v simply by adding not to the if clause. There are also flags you can add to do things like ignoring the case (flags=re.I), etc. Check out the docs for more.

Example: searching logs for errors
Say you want to look through the log file of a certain service on your system for errors. 

```python
with open('/var/log/some_service.log') as log:
    matches = (line for line in log if 'error:' in line.lower())
    # line.lower() is a substitute for -i in grep, in this case
````


* How to sed

sed can do a LOT of things. It's more or less "text editor" without a window. Instead of editing text manually, you give sed instructions about changes to apply to lines, and it does it all in one shot. (The default is to print what the file would look like with modification. The file isn't actually changed unless you use a special flag.)

I'm not going to cover all of that. Back when I wrote more shell scripts and less Python, the vast majority of my uses for sed were simply to use the substitution facilities to change instances of one pattern into something else, which is what I cover here.

```python
>>> # sed 's/a string/another string/g' -- i.e. doesn't regex
>>> replaced = (s.replace('a string', 'another string') for s in ics)
>>> # sed 's/pattern/replacement/g' -- needs regex
>>> replaced = (re.sub(r'pattern', r'replacement', s) for s in ics)
```


* How to awk
The sed section needed a little disclaimer. The awk section needs a bigger one. AWK is a Turing-complete text/table processing language. I'm not going to cover how to do everything AWK can do with Python idioms. [2]

However, inside of shell scripts, it's most frequently used to extract fields from tabular data, such as tsv files. Basically, it's used to split strings.

```python
>>> # awk '{print $1}'
>>> field1 = (f[0] for f in (s.split() for s in ics))
>>> # awk -F : '{print $1}'
>>> field1 = (f[0] for f in (s.split(':') for s in ics))
>>> # awk -F '[^a-zA-Z]' '{print $1}'
>>> field1 = (f[0] for f in (re.split(r'[^a-zA-Z]', s) for s in ics))
```



* Time

Getting the Time
In administrative scripting, one frequently wants to put a timestamp in a file name for naming logs or whatever. In a shell script, you just use the output of date for this. Python has two libraries for dealing with time, and either is good enough to handle this. The time module wraps time functions in libc. If you want to get a timestamp out of it, you do something like this:

```python
>>> import time
>>> time.strftime('%Y.%m.%d')
'2018.08.18'
```

This can use any of the format spec you see when you run $ man date. There is also a time.strptime function which will take a string as input and use the same kind of format string to parse the time out of it and into a tuple.

The datetime module provides classes for working with time at a high level. It's a little cumbersome for very simple things, and incredibly helpful for more sophisticated things like math involving time. The one handy thing it can do for our case is to give us a string of the current time without the need for a format specifier.

```python
>>> import datetime
>>> # get the current time as a datetime object
>>> datetime.datetime.now()
datetime.datetime(2018, 8, 18, 10, 5, 56, 518515)
>>> now = _
>>> str(now)
'2018-08-18 10:05:56.518515'
>>> now.strftime('%Y.%m.%d')
'2018.08.18'
```

This means that, if you're happy with the default string representation of the datetime class, you can just do str(datetime.datetime.now()) to get the current timestamp. There is also a datetime.datetime.strptime() to generate a datetime instance from a timestamp.
