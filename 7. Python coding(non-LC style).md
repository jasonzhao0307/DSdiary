## Chapter 7. Python coding (non-LC style)

* how to read a file and count how many characters are upper case? Do it in one line of code. 

```python
count = sum(1 for line in open('path_to_file') for char in line if char.isupper())
```

* What if the file is very large?

```python
with open('path_to_file') as fh:  
    count = sum(1 for line in fh for char in line if char.isupper())
```

* read file

```python
with open('my_file.txt') as my_file:
    for line in my_file:
        do_stuff_with(line.rstrip())

## the .rstrip() method is optional. It removes trailing whitespace
## from the line (including the newline character).
```

* If you don't want to iterate on lines, which is the most memory-efficient way to deal with text files, you can slurp entire contents of a file at once like this:

```python
with open('my_file.txt') as my_file:
    file_text = my_file.read()
```


* add parameters

Note that sys.argv[0] is the name of the script.

```python
import sys
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    do_stuff_with(arg)

```
