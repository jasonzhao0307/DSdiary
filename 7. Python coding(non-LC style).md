## Chapter 7. Python coding (non-LC style)

* how to read a file and count how many characters are upper case? Do it in one line of code. 

`
count = sum(1 for line in open('path_to_file') for char in line if char.isupper())
`

* What if the file is very large?

```
with open('path_to_file') as file:  
    count = sum(1 for line in file for char in line if char.isupper())
```
